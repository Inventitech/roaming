# Mobile Network Coverage Abroad

As our lives become more mobile and thanks to the EU's regulation to
[drop roaming
charges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union_roaming_regulations)
in June 2017, knowing which network service you will get in a foreign
country becomes ever more important. Unforunately, most providers do
not give out this information readily. In addition, many budget or
mobile virtual network operator (MVNO) offer fine 4G service in the
home country, but resort to second or third tier networks in foreign
countries.

**This list documents which mobile provider you will be using when you
go roaming in a foreign country.** It is ordered by the origin of your
home provider, and then lists in a table all known roaming partners
for this provider.

The document relies on your collaboration and really is a community
effort. If you have a provider that is not the list or visited a
country that is not in the list (of which there are many currently!),
please add it here by [filing a pull request on GitHub or creating an
issue](https://github.com/Inventitech/roaming-mobile-network-provider-abroad)!
Moreover, providers can change their partners, thus verifying existing
information by updating the date helps, too!
