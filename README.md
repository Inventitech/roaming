# Mobile Network Coverage Abroad

As our lives become more mobile and thanks to the EU's regulation to
[drop roaming
charges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union_roaming_regulations)
in June 2017, knowing which network service you will get in a foreign
country becomes ever more important. Unforunately, most providers do
not give out this information readily. In addition, many budget or
mobile virtual network operator (MVNO) offer fine 4G service in the
home country, but resort to second or third tier networks in foreign
countries.

*This list documents which mobile provider you will be using when you
go roaming in a foreign country.*

The document relies on our collaboration. If you have a provider that
is not the list or visited a country that is not in the list, please
